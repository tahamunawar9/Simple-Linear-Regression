# Simple-Linear-Regression
TV Price Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the prices of televisions (TVs) using a simple linear regression model. The project utilizes Python programming language and the scikit-learn library for machine learning.

# Project Overview
Predicting the prices of consumer electronics such as televisions can be valuable for both consumers and retailers. This project explores the use of a simple linear regression model to predict TV prices.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Python
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for implementing linear regression model
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

TV: TV Prices
sales: sales of the TV (target variable)
Project Workflow
Data Collection: Collect or generate a dataset containing information about TVs including their specifications and prices.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transformations of existing features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict TV prices based on the input features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Prediction: Make predictions on new data to estimate TV prices.
# Results
The simple linear regression model achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting TV prices based on the input features. Further analysis of the model's performance and potential areas for improvement can be explored.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of a simple linear regression model for predicting TV prices based on their specifications. By leveraging machine learning models, retailers and consumers can better understand the factors influencing TV prices and make informed decisions.
